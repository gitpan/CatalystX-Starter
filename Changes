        - Significant updates to generated skeleton to use new features.
          - Makefile.PL requires a reasonable version of Module::Install with
            working auto_install
          - Generated TestApp uses Catalyst 5.80
          - Generated scripts for TestApp use Catalyst::ScriptRunner
          - Generated compontent uses Moose and namespace::autoclean
          - Pod tests generated moved to t/author
          - M::I::AuthorRequires and M::I::AuthorTests used to run Pod tests.

        - Moved application skeleton into the lib/auto directory so that
          Module::Install's shonky install_share isn't used.
